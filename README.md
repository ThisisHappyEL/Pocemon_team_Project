## What this repository contains is a team project by a group of 5 students at Hexlet College.

### The project is a browser-based game, available at this link - https://thisishappyel.github.io/Pokemon_team_Project/

### We tried to capture the way the Pokemon series of games used to be played on older Nintendo consoles.

### This project features some unique monsters, tunes, and terrible beginner code thrown into a lake of classes, integrating JS into HTML and CSS, and working with a fairly solidly structured (by our standards) project
